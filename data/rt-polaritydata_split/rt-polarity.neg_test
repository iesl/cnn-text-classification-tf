this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
as pedestrian as they come . 
well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
it's just rather leaden and dull . 
the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
truly terrible . 
 . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor — but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
more precious than perspicacious
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
[a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
bad and baffling from the get-go . 
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
what an embarrassment . 
the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
it drowns in sap . 
all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
charming , if overly complicated . . . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish . 
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . 
pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
 . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with . 
lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
 if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
the film is strictly routine . 
it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
largely a for-fans artifact . 
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
it's not original enough . 
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
 . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
great story , bad idea for a movie . 
dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
a lame comedy . 
haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
 . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings . 
what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
an opportunity missed . 
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . 
nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
 . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
execrable . 
comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
most of the action setups are incoherent . 
an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
[a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
 . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
a porn film without the sex scenes . 
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction . 
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
phoned-in business as usual . 
i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
 . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
well , it does go on forever . 
a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
a puzzling experience . 
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
this is so bad . 
who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
odd and weird . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .

a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
everyone's to blame here . 
the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment . 
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
draggin' about dragons
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
degenerates into hogwash . 
this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters . 
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
well-meaning but inert . 
death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
feels familiar and tired . 
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
drowning's too good for this sucker . 
director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
technically and artistically inept . 
as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
[newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .

with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 . 
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
sluggish , tonally uneven . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines . 
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .

offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
 . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
staggeringly dreadful romance . 
director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .

a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
a picture as erratic as its central character . 
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
eh . 
any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives ! 
[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
 . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
unwieldy contraption . 
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
 . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
painfully padded . 
by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
'this movie sucks . '
let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
make like the title and dodge this one . 
in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises . 
this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them . 
neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
just not campy enough
the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story . 
 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
the film can depress you about life itself . 
by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
a high-minded snoozer . 
this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
teen movies have really hit the skids . 
[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
horrible
in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
in the end , there isn't much to it . 
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
 . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one . 
like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
[at least] moore is a real charmer . 
the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies . 
 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
 " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem…it's supposed to be a drama . 
a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
clever but not especially compelling . 
all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
 " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror . 
'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '
if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
i hate this movie
disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
a workshop mentality prevails . 
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
 " i blame all men for war , " [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . 
the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
doesn't amount to much of anything . 
while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
 . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
lacks dramatic punch and depth . 
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
an encouraging effort from mccrudden
william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . 
a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
wishy-washy . 
to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
two-bit potboiler . 
a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
 . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
 " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
an intriguing near-miss . 
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
parents beware ; this is downright movie penance . 
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
two hours of junk . 
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable . 
a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
tiresomely derivative and hammily acted . 
the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . 
it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .

the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .

this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
this is amusing for about three minutes . 
tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
everything is off . 
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
a very average science fiction film . 
comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect . 
will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
 . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . 
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos . 
witless and utterly pointless . 
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
[less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films . 
the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
 . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
been there done that . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
[t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
mild , meandering teen flick . 
the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours . 
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
 . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
dreary tale of middle-class angst
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
 . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
more of a career curio than a major work . 
it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
slick piece of cross-promotion . 
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying . 
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
 " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
extremely bad . 
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion . 
there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer . 
the pool drowned me in boredom . 
plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story . 
the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
 " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido . 
there's a lot of good material here , but there's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it . 
the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . 
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
fluffy and disposible . 
there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters . 
i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
insufferably naive . 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
…the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
don't waste your money . 
a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral . 
it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
boring and meandering . 
[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda .
