evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks . 
too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party . 
incoherence reigns . 
director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
fails to bring as much to the table . 
a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
black-and-white and unrealistic . 
never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution . 
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 
a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
crummy
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
 . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
the script ? please . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
the drama discloses almost nothing . 
solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
seems like someone going through the motions . 
a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
the action clichés just pile up . 
to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
 . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid . 
friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer . 
martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
an empty , purposeless exercise . 
if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
do not see this film . 
by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
a decidedly mixed bag . 
instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
not exactly the bees knees
[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation . 
loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
 . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
aan opportunity wasted . 
the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
meanders between its powerful moments . 
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
 . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
not so much farcical as sour . 
a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
a little too pat for its own good . 
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject . 
a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
[a] slummer . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
 . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
 . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
one of the worst movies of the year . 
if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
 . . . delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story . 
we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it's still not a good movie
nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 
the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
meandering and confusing . 
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense . 
something must have been lost in the translation . 
as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
…a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
an often unfunny romp . 
this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . 
distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
it tells more than it shows . 
i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
 . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
 . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .

an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
the film's center will not hold . 
sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
almost gags on its own gore . 
a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée . 
[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
death might be a release . 
all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 
in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
[l]ame and unnecessary . 
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
includes too much obvious padding . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
 . . . too dull to enjoy . 
strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
a movie to forget
what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
a half-assed film . 
tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .

a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ?

a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme .

it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up .

final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
well-meant but unoriginal . 
there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .

an ugly , revolting movie . 
the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !

calculated swill . 
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .

when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .

a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .

summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .

it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
 " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored . 
occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .

just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party . 
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .

the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs .

whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west .

feels like a cold old man going through the motions .

the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
too much of the humor falls flat . 
just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
 . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
leaks treacle from every pore . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
terminally brain dead production .

has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi .

it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick . 
it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh . 
dramatically lackluster . 
it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
arty gay film . 
coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
 . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
…passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
 . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
[javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
the gantzes' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook . 
once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
 . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
disjointed parody . 
there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) .

it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
abysmally pathetic
the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
 . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . 
each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
too silly to take seriously . 
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
stale , futile scenario . 
disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
shallow . 
a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
contrived pastiche of caper clichés . 
a grating , emaciated flick . 
it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
…the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience . 
this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
all mood and no movie . 
viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
 . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it . 
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
cinematic poo . 
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
nothing about this movie works . 
the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
by-the-numbers yarn . 
green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . 
blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
 . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
[serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
[a] poorly executed comedy . 
interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
brisk hack job . 
though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
less than fresh . 
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
pompous and garbled . 
the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
 " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
my own minority report is that it stinks . 
technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
this is nothing but familiar territory . 
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
a pint-sized 'goodfellas' designed to appeal to the younger set , it's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one's interest . 
the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers . 
'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
 . . . salaciously simplistic . 
do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
an awkward and indigestible movie . 
a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
[a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
one lousy movie . 
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
an awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work . 
in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel . 
slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
 . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
i think it was plato who said , 'i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
it's all surface psychodramatics . 
not once does it come close to being exciting . 
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
i'm just too bored to care . 
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
more maudlin than sharp . 
routine and rather silly . 
like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . 
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
 . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
 . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed . 
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
 . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
according to wendigo , 'nature' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves . 
[director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid . 
a dreary indulgence . 
they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through . 
the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work . 
well-made but mush-hearted . 
 . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
 . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
no surprises . 
sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
thin period piece . 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
 . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
a negligible british comedy . 
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
too much power , not enough puff . 
the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone . 
the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
entertaining enough , but nothing new
'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
low rent from frame one . 
 . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes . 
one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem . 
hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful . 
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it can't really be called animation . 
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
a dreary movie . 
entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
one long string of cliches . 
hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
nothing about it fits . 
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
a timid , soggy near miss . 
it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
ecks this one off your must-see list . 
think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police . 
yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence . 
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
the story has little wit and no surprises . 
nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness . 
it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
 " freaky friday , " it's not . 
the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
very stupid and annoying . 
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
 . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
more trifle than triumph . 
full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected . 
when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
too simple for its own good . 
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
oozes condescension from every pore . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . 
it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 
we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
this is no " waterboy ! " 
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
the movie bounces all over the map . 
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
[macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone . 
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
 . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
[a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner . 
the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs . 
it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
wait for it to hit cable . 
it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
not even the hanson brothers can save it
yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out . 
as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
ararat feels like a book report
despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
decent but dull . 
none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
below is well below expectations . 
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
where the film falters is in its tone . 
clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but . . . it's at least watchable . 
uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
banal and predictable . 
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . 
the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john . 
no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing . 
unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
 . . . a confusing drudgery . 
simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus . 
it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
schindler's list it ain't . 
mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values . 
sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 . 
elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
earnest but heavy-handed . 
 . . . they missed the boat . 
viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . 
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
though catch me if you can isn't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie . 
fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books . 
i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
 . . . one resurrection too many . 
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
just a kiss is a just a waste . 
eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . 
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
 . . . hokey art house pretension . 
in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
[t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
grating and tedious . 
director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
aggravating and tedious . 
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
they should have called it gutterball . 
 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies . 
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
the film is flat . 
with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
a sudsy cautionary tale . 
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'the ring . '
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire . 
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
mildly amusing . 
made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
 " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together . 
none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
storytelling feels slight . 
the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority . 
spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . 
unless you're a fanatic , the best advice is : 'scooby' don't . 
in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24/7 . 
the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
 . . . too sappy for its own good . 
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
show me the mugging . 
gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
a noble failure . 
put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot . 
too slow , too long and too little happens . 
what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
[a] stuporously solemn film . 
it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
who needs love like this ? 
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
just a bloody mess . 
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
crikey indeed . 
[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .

as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
frenetic but not really funny . 
what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .

they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .

narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .

one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .

the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .

not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names .

too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .

done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
 " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia .

proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .

the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
best described as i know what you did last winter .

i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .

the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
woefully pretentious .

a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
are monsters born , or made ? 
screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
thoroughly awful . 
obvious
kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
doesn't really add up to much . 
this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
holden caulfield did it better . 
it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .

suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let's just say the ingredients don't quite add up to a meal .

a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .

with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
don't even bother to rent this on video .

if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
a relative letdown .

`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit

aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .

a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients . 
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .

here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
a sour , nasty offering . 
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
[evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
[a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?

bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
predictably melodramatic . 
 . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .

the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
it's splash without the jokes . 
it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .

this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
a dreadful live-action movie . 
fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson .

where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines . 
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .

this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips .

writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
narc is all menace and atmosphere .

the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .

i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't .

it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
lurid and less than lucid work . 
everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
the central story lacks punch . 
the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
'carente de imaginación , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance , es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y dinero'
 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture . 
rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
 . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set . 
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
more tiring than anything . 
some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
 . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
shrewd but pointless . 
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . 
the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
a major waste . . . generic . 
doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
bearable . barely . 
kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
it doesn't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject . 
so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier . 
a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
 " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious . 
no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative . 
too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
demands too much of most viewers . 
exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
