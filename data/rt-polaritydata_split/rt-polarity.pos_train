 . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks .

wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you .

it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
beautifully produced . 
the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .

the all-french cast is marveilleux .

take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .

the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile . 
absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true .

the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .

awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 
often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . 
a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy .
